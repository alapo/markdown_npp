# markdown_npp

## Overview

This project provides a very simple user defined language file for Notepad++ that does some basic syntax highlighting for markdown texts. This is my version of the markdown theme for notepad++, if you want the original one, go [here](https://github.com/jjchiw/markdown_npp).

## Usage

Installation instructions (taken from Notepad++ Web site [1]):

1. Download the user-defined language to your computer
   - Right-click on [userDefineLang.xml (RAW file format)][raw] and choose 'Save As'
2. In Notepad++ : 
   1. Choose menu `Language` > `Define your own language`
   2. Click `Import` 
   3. In the open dialog, browse to and select your downloaded *userDefineLang.xml* file, and click `open`.
   4. Wait for the 'Import successful' dialog to be shown.
5. Open a Markdown file in Notepad++ (file extension must be *.md* or *.markdown*)
   - Notepad++ _should_ format the file with Markdown language style
   - To manually choose Markdown style, select menu `Language` > `Markdown`
